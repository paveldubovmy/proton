# VTV Nucleon Structure Solver (v1300.3)

Scientific implementation of the Modified Skyrme Model with a topological core ($L_6$ term). 
This project resolves the **Proton Radius Puzzle** by predicting a geometric bridge between muonic and electronic measurements.

## Core Results:
- **Lambda (Coherence Scale):** 0.04295 fm
- **Proton RMS Radius:** 0.8548 fm (Bridge Value)
- **Proton Mass:** 938.272 MeV (Calibrated)
- **Neutron Mass:** 939.579 MeV (Predicted with 14 keV accuracy)
